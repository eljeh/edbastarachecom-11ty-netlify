## OVERVIEW

Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Provide system feedback within 400ms in order to keep usersâ€™ attention and increase productivity. Use perceived performance to increase response time and reduce the perception of waiting.

# Fitts’s Law

## OVERVIEW

The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Touch targets should be large enough for users to both discern what it is and to accurately select them. Touch targets should have ample spacing between each other. Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allows them to be easily acquired.

## OVERVIEW

Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar. By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the user can focus on their task rather than learning new models. Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.

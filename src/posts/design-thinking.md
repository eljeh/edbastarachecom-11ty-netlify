## User center design that is a non-linear process
<article class="content">
Let's dive into the exciting world of Design Thinking and explore its five stages. One important thing to know is that Design Thinking is all about user-centered design and it's a non-linear process, which means we can jump back and forth between the stages. Ready? Let's go!
Empathize: This stage is all about understanding the people we're designing for. We put ourselves in their shoes and truly empathize with their needs, desires, and challenges. We interview them, observe them, and gather as much information as possible to gain deep insights into their experiences. It's like stepping into their world and seeing things from their perspective.

Define: In this stage, we take all the information we've gathered and start defining the problem we want to solve. We identify the core issues and frame them in a way that guides our design process. It's about clearly understanding what we're trying to tackle and setting a clear goal for our design.

Ideate: Now comes the fun and creative part! We brainstorm a ton of ideas without any judgment or limitation. We let our imaginations run wild and explore various possibilities. It's like a big idea party where we come up with crazy, innovative, and out-of-the-box solutions to the problem at hand. The more ideas, the better!

Prototype: This stage is all about bringing our ideas to life in a tangible way. We create prototypes or models that represent our designs. It can be anything from sketches and mock-ups to physical models or interactive digital prototypes. Prototyping helps us test and refine our ideas before investing too much time or resources.

Test: Now it's time to put our prototypes to the test. We gather feedback from the users and observe how they interact with our designs. We learn from their reactions, thoughts, and suggestions. If something doesn't work or needs improvement, we iterate and make necessary changes. Testing helps us refine our designs based on real-world feedback.

Remember, these stages aren't always linear. We may need to go back and forth between them, refining our understanding, redefining the problem, generating more ideas, prototyping, and testing again. Design Thinking is an iterative process that allows us to continually improve and enhance our designs.

Design Thinking empowers us to create user-centered solutions that truly address people's needs and improve their lives. It combines empathy, creativity, critical thinking, and a willingness to learn from failure.

## OVERVIEW

The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Touch targets should be large enough for users to both discern what it is and to accurately select them. Touch targets should have ample spacing between each other. Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allows them to be easily acquired.

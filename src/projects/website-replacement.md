The Search Results Page Refactoring project for Boardwalk REIT aimed to enhance the performance, design, and user experience of their property search results page.

Furthermore, the refactoring intended also investigate  a redesign the search results page and introduce an advanced filter system to empower users in refining their searches effectively.

Our team conducted a thorough competitor analysis to identify successful search filters and property information display methods used by other real estate listings platforms. These valuable insights from the research played a pivotal role in the redesign process, ensuring that Boardwalk REIT's website stands out from the competition once implemented.

To improve user engagement and conversion rates, we reassessed the user journey and conversion points. This evaluation enabled us to optimize the user experience by creating a seamless and intuitive navigation flow.

The primary focus of this project was to  investigate restructuring the UI, making it more user-friendly. Through simplified navigation and improved visual hierarchy, we will create an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive interface that enhances user satisfaction.

In conclusion, the implementation of the Search Results Page Refactoring project would be expected to bring significant improvements to Boardwalk REIT's website. The redesigned search results page, modern HTML and CSS implementation, advanced filter system, and enhanced user experience are anticipated to drive increased user engagement and improved conversion rates.

### Project Debriefing: Rent Calculator Widget with Affordable Rental Property Recommendations

The objective of our web-based tool was to simplify the process of finding affordable rental properties based on income, using CMHC's Rental Market Data. The Rent Calculator Widget provides users with an intuitive interface to make well-informed decisions regarding their housing options.

Our main goal for the Rent Calculator project was to create a user-friendly tool that helps individuals and families find rental properties within their affordability range. By calculating an affordable rent range based on the user's monthly income and CMHC's Rental Market Data, the widget presents a prefiltered link to list of rental properties that fall within this range.

We prioritized developing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the widget. The design is easy to navigate, allowing users to input their monthly income effortlessly and quickly access the list of recommended rental properties within their affordability range.

We ensured that the Rent Calculator Widget is responsive and compatible with various devices, ensuring seamless access regardless of the user's device. By employing a user-friendly interface, the widget facilitates informed decision-making about housing options.
